**[Languages]**: _English_

Adds the select tool to controls of AmbientLights, AmbientSounds, Notes, and MeasuredTemplates,

This enables selection, deletion, and movement of multiple lights, sounds, notes and templates.

This module checks if a select tool is there before adding it(also thanks to Blitz) and makes sure to only do anything if this module added the select tool, so it should be safe to use with other modules that add a select tool.

This will probably be obsolete in the future.

## Installation

1. select-tool-everywhere using manifest URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KayelGee/select-tool-everywhere/master/module.json
2. While loaded in World, enable **_Select tool everywhere"_** module.

## Usage

Select the select tool. Select your sounds/templates you wish to move all at once. Drag one sound/template to move them all.
